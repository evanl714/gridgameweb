- Have predefined scenarios for complex game states
- Include edge cases like nearly-depleted resources, low health units

### Automated vs Manual Testing
- Automate repetitive functionality tests
- Manually test user experience and visual feedback
- Use Playwright for DOM interaction verification
- Include screenshot comparisons for visual regression testing

- **UI Interactions**: All buttons, clicks, hovers
- **Error Conditions**: All failure modes
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and limits
- **Performance**: Response times and resource usage
- **Browser Compatibility**: Cross-browser functionality

This comprehensive test suite should identify any non-functional areas and provide a roadmap for debugging and fixing the current game implementation.
