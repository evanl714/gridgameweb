# ISSUE-008: Unit Production System

**Status:** Closed
**Created:** 2025-07-18
**Completed:** 2025-07-19
**Assignee:** Claude
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** production, units, economy, phase-1

## Description

Implement the unit production mechanics that allow players to spend resources to create new units at their base during the Build phase.

**Time Estimate:** 5-7 hours (Actual: 6 hours)
**Dependencies:** [[ISSUE-007-ui-interface-system]] ✓
**Task Reference:** [[task-08-unit-production-system]] ✓

## Tasks

- [✓] Implement base building system
- [✓] Create unit purchase mechanics
- [✓] Integrate with Build phase restrictions
- [✓] Build unit placement logic near base
- [✓] Add production validation system

## Subtasks

- [✓] [[ISSUE-008-unit-production-system-a]] - Base building system
- [✓] [[ISSUE-008-unit-production-system-b]] - Unit purchase mechanics

## Acceptance Criteria

- Players can purchase units during Build phase
- Resources are correctly deducted for purchases
- New units appear near the player's base
- Production respects all game rules and limitations
- Build system integrates seamlessly with UI

## Implementation Summary

### Core Features Implemented

**Base System:**
- Created Base class with health (200 HP), damage/healing mechanics, and serialization
- Implemented base initialization at fixed starting positions: Player 1 (5,5), Player 2 (19,19)
- Added visual representation using black square (⬛) with player colors
- Integrated base health bars for damaged bases

**Unit Production Constraints:**
- Units must be built within 3-square Manhattan distance of player's base
- Validation occurs both in UI (build panel) and backend (createUnit method)
- Enhanced build panel with pre-validation and clear error messaging
- Added helpful build tips: "Units must be built near your base"

**Technical Implementation:**
- Extended `shared/constants.js` with BASE_CONFIG and ENTITY_CHARACTERS
- Enhanced `gameState.js` with Base class and proximity validation methods
- Updated `game.js` with drawBases() rendering function
- Modified `buildPanel.js` for base proximity validation and user feedback

**Testing & Quality Assurance:**
- Created comprehensive `tests/baseSystem.test.js` with 18 unit tests
- Updated `tests/functional-complete.spec.js` with 6 base system integration tests
- Fixed ESLint formatting issues (4000+ automatic fixes)
- Achieved 59/59 passing tests for core functionality

### Product Requirements Definition (PRD)

**User Stories:**
- As a player, I can only build units near my base, adding strategic positioning importance
- As a player, I receive clear feedback when trying to build in invalid locations
- As a player, I can see my base health and position at all times

**Technical Requirements:**
- Unit placement restricted to 3-square radius from player bases
- Base entities with health system for future combat integration
- Visual feedback for base positions and health status
- Error handling for invalid placement attempts

**Acceptance Criteria:** ✅ ALL MET
- ✅ Players can purchase units during Build phase
- ✅ Resources are correctly deducted for purchases  
- ✅ New units appear near the player's base
- ✅ Production respects all game rules and limitations
- ✅ Build system integrates seamlessly with UI

## Comments

### 2025-07-18 - System Note
Unit production drives the strategic depth - ensure it's balanced and provides clear feedback.

### 2025-07-19 - Implementation Complete
Successfully implemented comprehensive base system with strategic unit placement constraints. Base proximity requirement adds tactical depth while maintaining intuitive user experience through clear UI feedback.
