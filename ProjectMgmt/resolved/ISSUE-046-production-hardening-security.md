# ISSUE-046: Production Hardening and Security

**Status:** RESOLVED
**Created:** 2025-07-24
**Assignee:** Claude Code
**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** security, production, deployment, monitoring

## Description

Development configurations and security measures need production readiness. Current setup has permissive CORS for development and lacks essential production security features including structured logging, security headers, rate limiting, and monitoring.

**Missing Production Features:**
- Structured logging (Winston/Pino)
- Security headers (helmet.js)
- Rate limiting
- Environment-specific configurations
- Error tracking/monitoring
- Health check endpoints

**Evidence:**
- `server/index.js:18-30` - Development-only CORS with permissive settings
- No security headers configured
- Missing structured logging infrastructure
- No rate limiting implementation

## Tasks

- [x] Implement helmet.js for security best practices
- [x] Add structured logging with Winston or Pino
- [x] Create environment-specific configurations
- [x] Add health check endpoints
- [x] Implement rate limiting middleware
- [x] Add performance metrics collection
- [x] Configure production CORS settings
- [x] Add error tracking/monitoring setup

## Subtasks

- [x] [[ISSUE-046-production-hardening-security-a]] - Install and configure helmet.js
- [x] [[ISSUE-046-production-hardening-security-b]] - Implement structured logging with Winston

## Comments

### 2025-07-24 - Code Audit Analysis

Security assessment reveals good foundation with prepared statements and clean separation, but missing production-ready security features. Current development CORS configuration needs hardening for production deployment.

**Success Criteria:**
- Production-ready security configuration
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Environment-specific deployments
- Performance metrics collection

**Effort Estimate:** 1-2 sprints  
**Business Value:** Medium (Production readiness, security)

## Implementation Log

### 2025-07-24 - Task Completion Verification

**Discovery:** All production hardening and security features were already implemented in the codebase but task tracking was outdated.

**Verified Implementations:**
- ✅ **Helmet.js Security Headers** - Configured in `server/index.js:30-55` with CSP, cross-origin policies
- ✅ **Multi-tier Rate Limiting** - General (100/15min), API (60/15min), Admin (10/hour) with security logging
- ✅ **Winston Structured Logging** - Full logging infrastructure with security event tracking
- ✅ **Environment Configuration** - Comprehensive config system in `server/config/environment.js`
- ✅ **Health Check Endpoints** - `/api/health`, `/api/health/detailed`, `/api/health/security`, `/api/health/performance`
- ✅ **Production CORS Policy** - Environment-aware CORS with configurable origins
- ✅ **Sentry Error Tracking** - Integrated error tracking with request tracing
- ✅ **Security Documentation** - Complete deployment checklist in `DEPLOYMENT-SECURITY-CHECKLIST.md`

**Security Features Active:**
- Request/response logging with metrics collection
- Security event monitoring (401/403 tracking, rate limit violations)
- Graceful error handling with structured logging
- Production-ready database configuration with WAL mode
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization setup

**Status:** All subtasks marked complete. Issue resolved.
