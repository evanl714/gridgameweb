# ISSUE-046: Production Hardening and Security

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2025-07-24
**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** security, production, deployment, monitoring

## Description

Development configurations and security measures need production readiness. Current setup has permissive CORS for development and lacks essential production security features including structured logging, security headers, rate limiting, and monitoring.

**Missing Production Features:**
- Structured logging (Winston/Pino)
- Security headers (helmet.js)
- Rate limiting
- Environment-specific configurations
- Error tracking/monitoring
- Health check endpoints

**Evidence:**
- `server/index.js:18-30` - Development-only CORS with permissive settings
- No security headers configured
- Missing structured logging infrastructure
- No rate limiting implementation

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement helmet.js for security best practices
- [ ] Add structured logging with Winston or Pino
- [ ] Create environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection
- [ ] Configure production CORS settings
- [ ] Add error tracking/monitoring setup

## Comments

### 2025-07-24 - Code Audit Analysis

Security assessment reveals good foundation with prepared statements and clean separation, but missing production-ready security features. Current development CORS configuration needs hardening for production deployment.

**Success Criteria:**
- Production-ready security configuration
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Environment-specific deployments
- Performance metrics collection

**Effort Estimate:** 1-2 sprints  
**Business Value:** Medium (Production readiness, security)
