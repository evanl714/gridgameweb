# ISSUE-048: Performance Optimization and Lazy Loading

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2025-07-24
**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Priority:** Low
**Labels:** performance, optimization, lazy-loading, code-splitting

## Description

Implement performance optimizations including lazy loading for game modules, code splitting for large components, and caching strategies to improve application startup time and runtime performance. Current architecture supports these optimizations but they haven't been implemented.

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Implement lazy loading for game modules
- Add code splitting for large components
- Optimize rendering pipeline for large grids
- Implement caching strategies for game state
- Add performance monitoring and metrics

**Current Performance Characteristics:**
- Command history configurable size (default 50) prevents memory growth
- Event system with priority-based listener management
- Memory leak prevention built into Observer pattern
- Dual rendering strategies for different performance profiles

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement lazy loading for game modules
- [ ] Add code splitting for large components
- [ ] Optimize rendering pipeline for large grids (25x25 and larger)
- [ ] Implement caching strategies for game state
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics collection
- [ ] Optimize command history management
- [ ] Implement efficient event listener management

## Comments

### 2025-07-24 - Code Audit Analysis

Performance analysis shows good foundation with configurable command history limits, priority-based event system, and dual rendering strategies. ES6 modular architecture enables lazy loading and code splitting. Current largest file is only 1,001 lines indicating reasonable complexity.

**Architecture Advantages:**
- ES6 modules enable lazy loading
- Event-driven architecture supports distributed processing
- Command pattern with configurable history limits
- Memory monitoring built into test suite

**Success Criteria:**
- Faster application startup time
- Reduced memory usage during gameplay
- Improved rendering performance for large grids
- Performance metrics collection and monitoring

**Effort Estimate:** 3-4 weeks  
**Business Value:** Medium (Better user experience, scalability)
