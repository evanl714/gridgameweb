# ISSUE-026: Grid Rendering System

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2025-07-18
**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** grid, rendering, coordinates

## Description

Implement the core 25x25 grid rendering with alternating light/dark squares and coordinate system for pixel-to-grid conversion.

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours
**Dependencies:** [[ISSUE-025-canvas-setup]]
**Parent Task:** [[ISSUE-002-canvas-grid-foundation]]
**Subtask Reference:** [[ISSUE-002-canvas-grid-foundation-b]]

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement 25x25 grid calculation and layout
- [ ] Create alternating light/dark square pattern
- [ ] Add coordinate system (0-24 for both x and y)
- [ ] Implement pixel-to-grid coordinate conversion functions

## Acceptance Criteria

- 25x25 grid renders correctly with proper dimensions
- Alternating color pattern matches chess-board design
- Coordinate conversion functions work accurately
- Grid adapts to canvas size changes
- Performance is smooth for grid rendering
