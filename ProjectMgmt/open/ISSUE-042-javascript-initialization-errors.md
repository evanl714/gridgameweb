# ISSUE-042: JavaScript Initialization Errors

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2025-07-22
**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** critical, bug, javascript, initialization

## Description

Multiple JavaScript errors prevent proper game initialization. Critical functions are missing and duplicate declarations cause conflicts.

**Specific Errors:**
1. `TypeError: this.gameState.removeAllListeners is not a function` (at game.js:73:22)
2. `Identifier 'gameBoard' has already been declared` 
3. Grid adapter initialization timeout after 5 seconds
4. 49 failed initialization attempts before giving up

**Impact:** Prevents game from starting properly and causes repeated initialization failures.

- [ ] Fix removeAllListeners missing function error
- [ ] Resolve gameBoard duplicate declaration

Console shows repeated errors during game startup. The removeAllListeners error occurs during both game initialization and New Game button clicks.
