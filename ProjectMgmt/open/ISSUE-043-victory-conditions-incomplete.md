# ISSUE-043: Victory Conditions Incomplete

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2025-07-22
**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** bug, game-logic, victory-conditions

## Description

Victory condition system is partially implemented. Surrender functionality works (shows confirmation dialog and updates status) but the game doesn't properly end or disable further actions.

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Surrender button shows confirmation dialog
- ✅ Status updates to "Player 1 surrendered!"
- ❌ Game continues accepting input after surrender
- ❌ No victory screen appears
- ❌ Other victory conditions untestable due to grid issues

**Expected Behavior:**
- Game should become non-interactive after surrender
- Victory screen should appear with appropriate messaging
- All buttons should be disabled except "New Game"

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement proper game-ending logic after surrender
- [ ] Create and display victory screen
- [ ] Disable game controls after victory
- [ ] Test resource victory condition (500+ resources)
- [ ] Test elimination victory condition
- [ ] Test base destruction victory condition

## Subtasks

- [ ] [[ISSUE-043-victory-conditions-incomplete-a]] - Implement post-surrender game state
- [ ] [[ISSUE-043-victory-conditions-incomplete-b]] - Create victory screen UI
- [ ] [[ISSUE-043-victory-conditions-incomplete-c]] - Disable controls after victory
- [ ] [[ISSUE-043-victory-conditions-incomplete-d]] - Test all victory condition types

## Related Issues

- [[ISSUE-040-critical-grid-rendering-failure]] (blocks testing of some victory conditions)

## Relationships

- Depends on: [[ISSUE-040-critical-grid-rendering-failure]] (for testing resource/elimination victories)

Surrender confirmation works correctly, but the game doesn't properly transition to a "game over" state. This allows continued interaction when the game should be ended.
