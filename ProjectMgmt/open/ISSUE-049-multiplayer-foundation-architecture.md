# ISSUE-049: Multiplayer Foundation Architecture

**Status:** WIP
**Created:** 2025-07-24
**Assignee:** Claude Code
**Priority:** Strategic
**Labels:** multiplayer, websockets, architecture, real-time

## Description

Establish foundation for multiplayer functionality leveraging the existing event-driven architecture. The current codebase is excellently positioned for multiplayer expansion with its Command pattern for action synchronization, Observer pattern for real-time updates, and database schema that supports multiple games/players.

**Architectural Advantages:**
- Event-driven architecture supports real-time updates
- Command pattern enables action synchronization
- Database schema supports multiple games/players
- WebSocket integration points identified
- Observer pattern facilitates state broadcasting

**Multiplayer Requirements:**
- Real-time game state synchronization
- Player action coordination
- Session management
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous actions
- Spectator mode support

## Tasks

- [ ] Design multiplayer architecture and communication protocol
- [ ] Implement WebSocket server integration
- [ ] Add real-time state synchronization
- [ ] Create player session management
- [ ] Implement action conflict resolution
- [ ] Add lobby system for game creation/joining
- [ ] Create spectator mode functionality
- [ ] Add player authentication and authorization

## Comments

### 2025-07-24 - Code Audit Analysis

Architecture analysis confirms excellent positioning for multiplayer expansion. The existing Command pattern can handle action synchronization, Observer pattern supports real-time updates, and database schema already supports multiple games/players. WebSocket integration points have been identified in the current architecture.

**Existing Foundation:**
- Command pattern for action synchronization
- Observer pattern for event broadcasting
- Database schema supports multiplayer data
- Clean state management architecture
- Event-driven design reduces coupling

**Success Criteria:**
- Real-time multiplayer gameplay functionality
- Smooth action synchronization between players
- Robust session management
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous actions
- Scalable lobby and matchmaking system

**Effort Estimate:** 6-8 weeks  
**Business Value:** Strategic (Major feature expansion)
