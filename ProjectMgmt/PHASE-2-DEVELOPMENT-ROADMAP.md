# Phase 2 Development Roadmap: Architecture Foundation

**Phase Duration:** 2025-07-25 → 2025-08-15 (4 weeks)  
**Strategic Focus:** Modular Architecture & Global State Elimination  
**Expected Outcome:** Foundation for scalable, testable, maintainable codebase  

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 represents a fundamental architectural transformation of the Grid Game Web codebase. Based on OODA cycle strategic analysis, this phase addresses the two highest-impact architectural bottlenecks:

1. **TIER 1 PRIORITY**: Global State Elimination (10x multiplier effect)
2. **TIER 2 PRIORITY**: Monolithic File Decomposition (8x multiplier effect)

These improvements will establish the foundation for all future development, including multiplayer functionality, advanced testing capabilities, and team collaboration scalability.

## Strategic Context

### Current State Assessment
- **Security Foundation**: ✅ COMPLETED in Phase 1
- **Global Dependencies**: 16 window.game references prevent modular architecture
- **Monolithic Files**: 4 files over 600 lines create maintenance bottlenecks
- **Testing Limitations**: Global state prevents comprehensive unit testing
- **Architectural Debt**: Mixed concerns and deep coupling limit scalability

### Target State Vision
- **Zero Global Dependencies**: 100% dependency injection architecture
- **Modular File Structure**: All modules under 300 lines with single responsibility
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit testing with dependency mocking capabilities
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with defined boundaries
- **Development Velocity**: 10x improvement in feature development speed
