Here's a list of things that need to be changed/fixed:

- the select worker button doesn't appear to do anything - confirm if its necessary
- The save game button can be removed
- The reset button can be removed
- The stats in the top right do not update, it is stuck on turn 1 with phase:resource
- Move the bases to 1,23 and 23,1
- Remove the recent activity box in the sidebar
- Units seem to only be buildable near one of the bases, not the other one
- The build panel on the sidebar is just text, there's no buttons
- The game auto ends after turn 5, saying one of the bases has been destroyed
- The text that appears after the game ends pops up below the footer of the page, i think we need to implement a proper notification system overall or modal for that specifically
