# Task 01: Project Initialization & Setup

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Dependencies:** None  

## Overview
Initialize the project structure with the lean approach outlined in the implementation plan. Set up the basic file structure and development environment.

## Subtasks

### 1.1 Create Basic File Structure
- [ ] Create `public/` directory
- [ ] Create `server/` directory  
- [ ] Create `shared/` directory
- [ ] Create initial `package.json` with basic dependencies

### 1.2 Set Up Package Configuration
- [ ] Initialize npm project
- [ ] Add Express.js dependency
- [ ] Add SQLite3 dependency
- [ ] Add development dependencies (nodemon)
- [ ] Create start scripts in package.json

### 1.3 Create Initial Files
- [ ] Create `public/index.html` with basic HTML structure
- [ ] Create `public/style.css` with reset styles
- [ ] Create `public/game.js` as empty entry point
- [ ] Create `server/index.js` with basic Express setup
- [ ] Create `shared/constants.js` with game constants

### 1.4 Development Environment
- [ ] Set up .gitignore for Node.js project
- [ ] Create basic README.md with setup instructions
- [ ] Test that server starts without errors
- [ ] Verify static file serving works

## Acceptance Criteria
- Project structure matches the lean architecture plan
- npm start successfully launches the server
- Browser can access index.html via localhost
- All placeholder files are created and functional

## Notes
Following the "build what you need" philosophy - no TypeScript, React, or Docker yet.
