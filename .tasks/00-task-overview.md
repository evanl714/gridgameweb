    - Test framework, rule validation, edge case handling

**Phase 2 Total: ~18-24 hours**

### Phase 3: User Experience (Medium Priority)
**Tasks 14-16** - Polish and accessibility

14. **Task 14: Mobile Optimization** (6-8h)
    - Touch controls, responsive design, mobile UX

15. **Task 15: Game Polish & Animations** (8-12h)
    - Visual effects, animations, sound integration

16. **Task 16: Tutorial & Onboarding** (10-12h)
    - Interactive tutorial, help system, player education

**Phase 3 Total: ~24-32 hours**

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
**Tasks 17-20** - AI, online multiplayer, production

19. **Task 19: Performance Optimization** (8-10h)
    - Rendering optimization, memory management, scaling

20. **Task 20: Deployment & DevOps** (6-8h)
    - Production deployment, monitoring, CI/CD

**Phase 4 Total: ~41-53 hours**

## Development Strategy

### MVP Target (Phase 1)
The minimum viable product includes all Phase 1 tasks, resulting in a fully playable local strategy game with all core mechanics implemented.

### Iterative Development
- Complete each task before moving to the next
- Test thoroughly after each phase
- Gather user feedback after Phase 1 and Phase 2
- Adjust priorities based on feedback

### Dependencies
- Tasks within each phase have sequential dependencies
- Some cross-phase dependencies exist (e.g., Task 18 builds on Task 11)
- Mobile optimization (Task 14) should be done before animations (Task 15)

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Core Game)**: 7-9 weeks (assuming 8h/week)
- **Phase 2 (Multiplayer)**: 3-4 weeks  
- **Phase 3 (UX)**: 4-5 weeks
- **Phase 4 (Advanced)**: 6-8 weeks

**Total Project: 20-26 weeks** for complete implementation

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 1**: Playable local multiplayer game
- **Phase 2**: Persistent game sessions, pass-and-play works smoothly  
- **Phase 3**: Mobile-friendly with great user experience
- **Phase 4**: Production-ready with AI and online capabilities

## Notes

- Follow lean development principles - build what's needed, when it's needed
- Prioritize user feedback and iteration over perfect first implementations  
- Each phase should result in a demonstrable improvement to the game
- Performance and quality should be maintained throughout
