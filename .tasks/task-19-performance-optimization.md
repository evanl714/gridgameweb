# Task 19: Performance Optimization & Scaling

**Priority:** Low  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours  
**Dependencies:** Task 18

## Overview

Optimize game performance for smooth gameplay with large numbers of units and prepare the codebase for scaling to support more concurrent players.

## Subtasks

### 19.1 Rendering Performance

- [ ] Implement canvas dirty region updates
- [ ] Add object pooling for units and effects
- [ ] Optimize drawing call batching
- [ ] Create level-of-detail rendering

### 19.2 Game Logic Optimization

- [ ] Profile and optimize hot code paths
- [ ] Implement efficient pathfinding algorithms
- [ ] Add spatial indexing for unit lookups
- [ ] Optimize collision detection

### 19.3 Memory Management

- [ ] Implement garbage collection optimization
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Create efficient data structures
- [ ] Handle memory leaks in long games

### 19.4 Network Performance

- [ ] Implement delta compression for state updates
- [ ] Add client-side prediction
- [ ] Optimize message serialization
- [ ] Create bandwidth usage monitoring

### 19.5 Scalability Preparation

- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Create load testing framework
- [ ] Implement horizontal scaling preparation
- [ ] Add resource usage analytics

## Acceptance Criteria

- Game runs smoothly with 50+ units per player
- Frame rate stays above 30fps on mid-range devices
- Memory usage remains stable during long games
- Network performance is optimized for real-time play
- Performance metrics guide future optimizations

## Notes

Performance optimization should be data-driven. Measure before and after all changes.
