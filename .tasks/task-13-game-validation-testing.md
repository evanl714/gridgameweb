# Task 13: Game Logic Validation & Testing

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours  
**Dependencies:** Task 12  
**Status:** Work in Progress  
**Assigned to:** Claude

## Overview

Implement comprehensive testing and validation for all game mechanics to ensure rules are enforced correctly and edge cases are handled properly.

## Subtasks

### 13.1 Unit Testing Framework

- [ ] Set up testing framework (Jest or similar)
- [ ] Create test utilities for game state manipulation
- [ ] Add test data generators
- [ ] Implement test coverage reporting

### 13.2 Game Rules Validation Testing

- [ ] Test all movement rules and restrictions
- [ ] Validate combat damage calculations
- [ ] Test resource collection mechanics
- [ ] Verify unit production constraints

### 13.3 Edge Case Testing

- [ ] Test board boundary conditions
- [ ] Handle full board scenarios
- [ ] Test simultaneous action conflicts
- [ ] Validate resource depletion edge cases

### 13.4 Turn System Testing

- [ ] Test phase transitions
- [ ] Validate turn switching
- [ ] Test action limitations per turn
- [ ] Verify turn rollback scenarios

### 13.5 Integration Testing

- [ ] Test complete game workflows
- [ ] Validate save/load functionality
- [ ] Test victory condition detection
- [ ] Verify database integration

## Acceptance Criteria

- All game rules are covered by automated tests
- Edge cases are identified and handled correctly
- Test suite runs quickly and reliably
- Code coverage exceeds 80% for game logic
- Tests catch rule violations and invalid states

## Notes

Solid testing prevents game-breaking bugs and ensures fair gameplay. Invest time here for quality.
