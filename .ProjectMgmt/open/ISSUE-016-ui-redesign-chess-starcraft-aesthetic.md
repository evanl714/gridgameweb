## Comments

### 2025-07-19 - System Note

This issue should be completed before ISSUE-015 (animations) as animations will be more impactful on a visually polished foundation. The UI redesign will establish the visual framework that animations can then enhance.

Current UI is described as "bland" and needs a complete overhaul to match the quality expectations of modern strategy games. Focus on creating that "chess.com meets starcraft 2" feel.
