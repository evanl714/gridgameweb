# ISSUE-040: Critical Grid Rendering Failure

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2025-07-22
**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** critical, bug, deployment, grid-rendering

## Description

CRITICAL BUG: The game grid canvas is completely non-functional on the Railway deployment. Canvas element exists but has `display: none` and size 0x0, making the core game unplayable.

**Test Results:**
- Expected: 25x25 grid (625 cells) with 9 resource nodes
- Actual: Canvas hidden, 0 visible grid cells, 0 resource nodes
- Console Error: "Grid adapter initialization failed: timeout after 5 seconds"
- 49 failed initialization attempts before timeout

**Impact:** Makes 95% of game functionality untestable and unplayable.

## Tasks

- [ ] Investigate grid adapter initialization timeout
- [ ] Fix canvas CSS display property
- [ ] Ensure grid cells render properly (625 expected)
- [ ] Verify resource nodes appear (9 expected)
- [ ] Test grid interactivity (clicking cells)
- [ ] Validate canvas sizing and positioning
