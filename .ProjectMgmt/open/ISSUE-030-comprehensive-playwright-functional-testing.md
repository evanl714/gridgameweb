## Acceptance Criteria
- Complete test coverage for all 7 completed issue functionalities
- Tests validate the full game loop: setup → resource phase → action phase → build phase
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) with consistent results
- Performance benchmarks for grid rendering with 50+ units
- Accessibility validation for screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Visual regression testing for UI components and game elements
- Error handling and edge case validation
- Mobile responsiveness testing for touch interactions
- Test suite runs in under 5 minutes with clear reporting
- All tests pass consistently with 95%+ reliability

## Test Coverage Requirements

### 1. Game Initialization & Setup (ISSUE-001)
- Project structure and file loading validation
- Server startup and localhost accessibility
- Initial HTML/CSS/JS loading and error-free execution
- Configuration and constants loading verification

### 2. Canvas Grid Foundation (ISSUE-002)
- 25x25 grid rendering with correct alternating colors
- Resource node placement verification (9 symmetric positions)
- Mouse interaction and coordinate mapping accuracy
- Responsive canvas behavior and proper centering
- Hover effects and visual feedback validation

### 3. Game State Management (ISSUE-003)
- Player initialization with correct starting values (100 energy, 3 actions)
- Unit management CRUD operations
- Turn phase system progression (Resource → Action → Build)
- Event system and state change notifications
- Save/load functionality with localStorage persistence
- Win condition detection (500 resources, elimination)

### 4. Unit Rendering System (ISSUE-004)
- Unicode character rendering for all 4 unit types (♦♙♗♖)
- Player color distinction (Blue #4169e1, Red #dc143c)
- Health bar display and dynamic updates
- Unit selection visual indicators (gold rings)
- Performance with multiple units (50+ unit stress test)

### 5. Basic Movement System (ISSUE-005)
- Click-to-select unit functionality
- Movement range highlighting (green overlays)
- Distance-based movement validation (Manhattan distance)
- Unit-specific movement ranges (Scout:4, Worker/Infantry:2, Heavy:1)
- Action consumption and validation
- Movement cost display and preview system
- Keyboard shortcuts (R toggle, Escape deselect)
- Collision detection and boundary validation

### 6. Resource Collection System (ISSUE-006)
- Worker unit resource gathering from adjacent nodes
- Resource node depletion (100→0) and regeneration (+5/turn)
- Collection rate validation (5 resources per action)
- Phase restriction enforcement (Resource phase only)
- Gather button states and keyboard shortcut (G key)
- Visual feedback for gatherable nodes (gold highlighting)
- Cooldown system validation (3-second intervals)

### 7. UI Interface System (ISSUE-007)
- Resource display updates in real-time
- Turn management interface accuracy
- Unit information display for selected units
- Build panel interface and cost display
- Game status tracking and phase indicators
- Mobile responsiveness and touch optimization
- All UI components render correctly and update dynamically

### 8. Complete Game Loop Integration
- Full turn progression: Resource → Action → Build → Next Player
- Multi-unit scenarios with complex interactions
- Resource collection → movement → strategic positioning workflow
- Player alternation and turn management
- Game state persistence across browser sessions
- Error recovery and invalid action handling

## Performance Benchmarks
- Grid rendering: <50ms for initial 25x25 grid
- Unit rendering: <100ms for 50+ units
- Movement calculation: <50ms for complex range calculations
- Resource collection: <30ms per gathering action
- UI updates: <20ms for real-time state changes
- Full game loop: <200ms for complete turn processing

## Browser Compatibility Matrix
- **Chrome (latest)**: All functionality with optimal performance
- **Firefox (latest)**: Full compatibility with minor performance variance
- **Safari (latest)**: Complete functionality with WebKit optimizations
- **Mobile Chrome/Safari**: Touch interactions and responsive design
- **Edge (Chromium)**: Full compatibility testing

## Accessibility Requirements
- Screen reader compatibility for all game information
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- High contrast mode support
- Unicode character accessibility
- ARIA labels for game state information
- Focus indicators for selected elements

## Comments
### 2025-07-19 - System Note
This comprehensive test suite serves as the quality gate for the completed Phase 1 functionality. It validates that all 7 completed issues work together as a cohesive, playable strategy game.

The test suite should simulate realistic player scenarios:
1. New game setup and initial unit placement
2. Resource gathering strategies with multiple workers
3. Unit movement and tactical positioning
4. Turn management and phase progression
5. UI interaction patterns and feedback systems
6. Complete game sessions with win condition validation

Focus on both individual component testing and integration scenarios that mirror actual gameplay patterns. The test suite will serve as regression protection for future development phases.
