# ISSUE-019: Performance Optimization & Scaling

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2025-07-18
**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Priority:** Low
**Labels:** performance, optimization, scaling, phase-4

## Description
Optimize game performance for smooth gameplay with large numbers of units and prepare the codebase for scaling to support more concurrent players.

**Time Estimate:** 8-10 hours
**Dependencies:** [[ISSUE-018-online-multiplayer-foundation]]
**Task Reference:** [[task-19-performance-optimization]]

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement rendering performance optimizations
- [ ] Optimize game logic algorithms
- [ ] Improve memory management
- [ ] Enhance network performance
- [ ] Prepare scalability infrastructure

- Network performance is optimized for real-time play
- Performance metrics guide future optimizations

## Comments
### 2025-07-18 - System Note
Performance optimization should be data-driven. Measure before and after all changes.
Focus on canvas dirty regions, object pooling, and spatial indexing.
