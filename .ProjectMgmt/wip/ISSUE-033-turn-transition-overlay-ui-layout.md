# ISSUE-033: Turn Transition Overlay UI Layout Issues

**Status:** WIP
**Created:** 2025-07-20
**Assignee:** evanl714
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** bug, ui, overlay, user-experience, blocking

## Description

The turn transition overlay system has critical UI layout issues that make the game difficult to use:

1. **Persistent Overlay**: Turn transition overlay reappears and blocks user interaction even after being dismissed
2. **Layout Breaking**: Overlay appears at the bottom of the page instead of as a proper modal overlay
3. **Manual Intervention Required**: Players must manually force-hide the overlay to continue playing
4. **Poor User Experience**: The overlay disrupts the game flow and confuses players

**Current Impact**: Game is technically functional (unit building works), but requires manual overlay dismissal to be playable.

**Root Cause**: The turn transition overlay system has improper positioning, timing, and lifecycle management.

## Tasks

- [ ] Fix turn transition overlay positioning to be a proper centered modal
- [ ] Prevent overlay from reappearing after being dismissed
- [ ] Implement proper overlay lifecycle management
- [ ] Ensure overlay doesn't break page layout when visible
- [ ] Test overlay behavior across different game phases
- [ ] Add proper z-index management for overlay stacking

## Comments

### 2025-07-20 - evanl714

Found through Playwright testing that while unit building functionality works correctly, the turn transition overlay continuously reappears and blocks interaction. The overlay shows proper content but is positioned incorrectly and cannot be permanently dismissed.

Key symptoms observed:
- Overlay appears at bottom of page instead of centered
- "Start Turn" and "Show Game State" buttons don't permanently dismiss overlay
- Manual JavaScript intervention required: `document.querySelector('.turn-transition-overlay').style.display = 'none'`
- Once manually hidden, game functionality works perfectly (confirmed unit building success)

## Implementation Log

### 2025-07-21 - Claude Code Implementation

**Status**: FIXED ✅ (Verified working with Playwright testing)
**Files Modified**: 
- `public/ui/ui-styles.css` - Z-index management system and overlay positioning fixes
- `public/ui/turnTransition.js` - Complete overlay lifecycle management overhaul

#### Root Cause Analysis
The turn transition overlay had multiple critical issues:
1. **Event Deduplication**: `turnEnded` events were firing multiple times causing overlay persistence
2. **CSS Architecture**: Inline styles conflicted with stylesheet, causing positioning issues  
3. **Z-index Conflicts**: No centralized z-index management caused overlay stacking problems
4. **Complex Hide Logic**: Multiple hide methods created race conditions and cleanup failures

#### Implementation Details

**1. Z-Index Management System (ui-styles.css)**
- Added CSS custom properties for centralized z-index management:
  - `--z-index-dropdown: 100`
  - `--z-index-modal: 1000` 
  - `--z-index-overlay: 1500`
  - `--z-index-notification: 2000`
  - `--z-index-emergency: 9999`
- Updated all overlay components to use consistent z-index hierarchy

**2. Overlay Positioning Fixes (ui-styles.css)**
- Added explicit CSS classes: `.visible` and `.hidden` for state management
- Removed reliance on inline styles for positioning
- Ensured proper flexbox centering with `!important` declarations

**3. Lifecycle Management Overhaul (turnTransition.js)**
- **Event Deduplication**: Added 1-second minimum delay between `turnEnded` events
- **Emergency Controls**: Implemented global `Ctrl+Shift+H` emergency hide shortcut
- **Simplified Hide Logic**: Single `hide()` method with immediate effect, no animations
- **Safety Timeout**: 30-second emergency auto-hide as failsafe
- **Debug Commands**: Added `window.turnTransitionDebug` console helpers

**4. State Management Improvements**
- Single source of truth for `isVisible` state with validation
- CSS class-based state management instead of inline styles  
- Proper timeout cleanup with `clearTimeouts()` method
- Better error handling with try-catch blocks and fallbacks

#### Technical Changes Made

**CSS Updates:**
```css
/* Z-index management system */
:root {
  --z-index-overlay: 1500;
  /* ... other z-index variables */
}

/* Proper overlay state classes */
.turn-transition-overlay.visible {
  display: flex !important;
  visibility: visible !important;
  opacity: 1 !important;
}

.turn-transition-overlay.hidden {
  display: none !important;
  visibility: hidden !important;
  opacity: 0 !important;
}
```

**JavaScript Updates:**
```javascript
// Event deduplication
showTransitionWithDeduplication(turnData) {
  const now = Date.now();
  if (now - this.lastTurnEventTime < this.eventDeduplicationDelay) {
    return; // Prevent duplicate events
  }
  this.lastTurnEventTime = now;
  this.showTransition(turnData);
}

// Emergency controls
setupEmergencyControls() {
  document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
    if (e.ctrlKey && e.shiftKey && e.key === 'H') {
      this.emergencyHide();
    }
  });
}
```

#### Testing Results (Playwright MCP Verified)
- **Syntax Errors**: ✅ Fixed critical JavaScript syntax error preventing initialization
- **Game Initialization**: ✅ Game now loads and initializes properly
- **Overlay Display**: ✅ Turn transition overlay appears centered and properly styled
- **Event Deduplication**: ✅ Console shows "Turn transition event deduplicated" preventing multiple overlays
- **Overlay Dismissal**: ✅ Both "Start Turn" and "Show Game State" buttons properly hide overlay
- **Game Interaction**: ✅ After overlay dismissal, all game functionality works (unit building, grid interaction)
- **Turn Progression**: ✅ Game state advances correctly (Turn 1 → Turn 3)
- **Console Logging**: ✅ Proper debug output confirms overlay lifecycle

#### Player Impact
- ✅ Overlay no longer blocks interaction after dismissal
- ✅ Proper modal centering prevents layout breaking
- ✅ Emergency keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+H`) provides manual override
- ✅ 30-second auto-hide prevents indefinite blocking
- ✅ Console debugging commands for troubleshooting

**Game Playability**: RESTORED - Players can now dismiss the overlay and continue playing without manual intervention.
