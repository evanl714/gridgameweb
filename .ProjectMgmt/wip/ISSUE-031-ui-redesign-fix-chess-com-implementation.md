# ISSUE-031: UI Redesign Fix & Chess.com Implementation

**Status:** WIP
**Created:** 2025-07-19
**Assignee:** evanl714
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** ui, ux, redesign, bug-fix, visual-polish, phase-2

## Description

Fix the broken UI redesign from ISSUE-030 and implement a proper Chess.com-inspired interface. The current deployment shows a non-functional game with missing game board and incomplete aesthetic implementation. This issue addresses the critical JavaScript errors and implements a clean, professional Chess.com design with minimal StarCraft 2 HUD elements.

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours
**Dependencies:** ISSUE-030 (supersedes/fixes)
**Task Reference:** Fix and redesign

## Problem Analysis

From deployed application review, identified critical issues:
1. **Game board missing** - Core functionality broken due to DOM insertion error in uiManager.js
2. **JavaScript error** - `NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'insertBefore'` preventing UI initialization  
3. **Incomplete Chess.com aesthetic** - Current implementation is fragmented and doesn't match professional design

## Chess.com Design Analysis

Key design elements from Chess.com interface:
- **Dark sidebar** (#1a1a1a to #2c2c2c) with clean navigation
- **Bright green accent** (#7CB342) for primary actions like "Start Game"
- **Professional typography** with clear hierarchy  
- **Card-based panels** with subtle shadows and borders
- **Prominent central game board** as the focal point
- **Clean, minimal button styling** with good contrast
- **Right-side control panels** for game options

- [ ] Restore game board functionality and test New Game button
