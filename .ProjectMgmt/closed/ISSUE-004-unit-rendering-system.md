## Product Requirements Definition (PRD)

### Overview

The Unicode character rendering system replaces the previous basic circle+letter unit visualization with sophisticated Unicode symbols, providing clear visual distinction between unit types while maintaining excellent performance and accessibility.

### Implementation Details

#### Unicode Character Mapping

- **Worker (♦)**: Diamond symbol representing resource gathering units
- **Scout (♙)**: Pawn symbol representing fast reconnaissance units
- **Infantry (♗)**: Bishop symbol representing main battle units
- **Heavy (♖)**: Rook symbol representing elite combat units

#### Visual Specifications

- **Player Colors**: Blue (#4169e1) for Player 1, Red (#dc143c) for Player 2
- **Font System**: Serif fonts for optimal Unicode character support
- **Character Sizing**: 60% of cell size (19.2px at 32px cell size) for optimal visibility
- **Text Shadows**: Subtle shadow (1px offset, 2px blur) for enhanced contrast
- **Anti-aliasing**: Browser-optimized text rendering for crisp display

#### Technical Architecture

- **Rendering Engine**: HTML5 Canvas 2D context with optimized text rendering
- **Constants Management**: Centralized `UNIT_CHARACTERS` mapping in shared constants
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient font caching and shadow reset patterns
- **Memory Management**: Minimal overhead compared to previous circle rendering

#### Health and Status Display

- **Health Bars**: Positioned above units with dynamic color coding
- **Action Indicators**: Visual feedback for unit action status (exhausted/partial)
- **Selection System**: Maintained compatibility with existing selection mechanics
- **Positioning Logic**: Dynamic positioning based on character size for proper alignment

#### Accessibility Features

- **High Contrast**: Unicode characters provide better distinction than letters
- **Scalability**: Characters scale properly with different zoom levels
- **Screen Reader Support**: Unicode characters are accessible to assistive technology
- **Color Blind Friendly**: Clear shape distinction regardless of color perception

### Performance Characteristics

- **Rendering Speed**: Optimized text rendering outperforms previous circle drawing
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal memory footprint with cached font metrics
- **Scalability**: Tested and verified smooth performance with multiple units
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works across modern browsers with consistent appearance

### Testing and Validation

- **Unit Tests**: All 62 existing tests continue to pass
- **Visual Testing**: Manual verification of all four unit types with correct Unicode display
- **Performance Testing**: Confirmed smooth rendering with test scenarios
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Verified consistent appearance across different browsers
- **Accessibility Testing**: Unicode characters properly accessible to screen readers

### Integration Points

- **Game State**: Seamless integration with existing unit management system
- **Canvas Rendering**: Enhanced `drawUnits()` method in game.js
- **User Interface**: Added missing "Next Phase" button for complete game flow
- **Event System**: Maintained compatibility with selection and interaction systems
