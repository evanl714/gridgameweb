# ISSUE-002: Canvas Grid Foundation

**Status:** Completed
**Created:** 2025-07-18
**Assignee:** Claude
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** canvas, rendering, phase-1

## Description
Create the core 25x25 grid rendering system using HTML5 Canvas. Implement the chess-like visual design with alternating light/dark squares.

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours
**Dependencies:** [[ISSUE-001-project-initialization-setup]]
**Task Reference:** [[task-02-canvas-grid-foundation]]

## Tasks
- [✓] Canvas setup and responsive behavior
- [✓] Grid rendering system with alternating colors
- [✓] Visual styling and hover effects
- [✓] Resource node placement in symmetric pattern
- [✓] Mouse interaction and coordinate mapping

## Subtasks
- [✓] [[ISSUE-002-canvas-grid-foundation-a]] - Canvas setup
- [✓] [[ISSUE-002-canvas-grid-foundation-b]] - Grid rendering system
- [✓] [[ISSUE-002-canvas-grid-foundation-c]] - Visual styling
- [✓] [[ISSUE-002-canvas-grid-foundation-d]] - Resource node placement
- [✓] [[ISSUE-002-canvas-grid-foundation-e]] - Mouse interaction

## Related Issues
- Depends on: [[ISSUE-001-project-initialization-setup]]
- Blocks: [[ISSUE-003-game-state-management]]

## Relationships
- Implements: [[task-02-canvas-grid-foundation]] from .tasks

## Acceptance Criteria
- 25x25 grid renders correctly with alternating colors
- Resource nodes appear in correct symmetric positions  
- Mouse clicks accurately map to grid coordinates
- Grid is responsive and centers properly
- Hover effects provide clear visual feedback

## Product Requirement Definition (PRD)
### Implementation Details
- **Grid Specifications**: 25x25 grid using HTML5 Canvas (800x800px)
- **Visual Design**: Chess-like alternating pattern with light (#f8f9fa) and dark (#e9ecef) squares
- **Resource Nodes**: 9 symmetric positions with green styling (#32cd32) and 100 initial value
- **Interaction System**: Mouse hover effects and click-to-select with visual feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Canvas scales with viewport constraints (max-width: 100%, max-height: 70vh)

### Technical Implementation
- **Constants-Based Configuration**: Uses `GAME_CONFIG` and `UI_COLORS` from shared constants
- **Modular Architecture**: Separated grid rendering, resource management, and interaction logic
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient redraw system with coordinate mapping and canvas scaling
- **Cell Size**: 32px per cell for optimal display and performance balance

### Verification Results
All acceptance criteria verified through browser testing:
- ✅ 25x25 grid renders with proper alternating colors
- ✅ 9 resource nodes positioned symmetrically at coordinates: (4,4), (12,4), (20,4), (4,12), (12,12), (20,12), (4,20), (12,20), (20,20)
- ✅ Mouse interaction provides accurate coordinate mapping with console logging
- ✅ Responsive behavior and proper centering confirmed
- ✅ Hover effects and selection feedback working correctly

## Comments
### 2025-07-18 - System Note
Focus on clean, performant rendering. The grid will be redrawn frequently during gameplay.

### 2025-07-19 - Completion Note
Issue completed successfully. All tasks and subtasks implemented and verified. Canvas grid foundation ready for next development phase.
