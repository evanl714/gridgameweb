Created from fixes.md review - these are critical UI functionality issues that prevent proper game interaction.

### 2025-07-21 - Claude Implementation

**COMPLETED**: All UI control issues have been resolved.

**Key Findings**:
- "Select Worker" was NOT a separate button - it's the dynamic text of "Gather Resources" button (working correctly)
- "Save Game" and "Reset" buttons were fully implemented but removed per issue requirements
- Build panel sidebar was already fully functional with interactive unit cards

**Changes Made**:
- Removed Save Game button from HTML and JavaScript event listeners
- Removed Reset button from HTML and JavaScript event listeners  
- Kept underlying methods for potential future use
- Verified build panel sidebar works correctly (no changes needed)

**Files Modified**:
- `public/index.html` - Removed button elements
- `public/game.js` - Removed event listeners

**Testing**: âœ… All functionality verified - remaining buttons work properly, build panel shows interactive unit cards, no console errors.
