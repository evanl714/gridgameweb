- [✓] State can be serialized and restored

## Product Requirements Definition (PRD)

### Overview
The game state management system provides the core foundation for all game logic in the Grid Strategy Game. It implements a comprehensive state management architecture with event-driven updates and persistence capabilities.

### Core Components Implemented

#### 1. GameState Class (`public/gameState.js`)
- **Central State Container**: Manages 25x25 game board, players, units, and game status
- **Event System**: Publisher-subscriber pattern for state change notifications
- **Board Management**: 2D array tracking unit positions and occupancy
- **Game Flow**: Controls game status (ready/playing/paused/ended) and turn progression
- **Serialization**: Complete state serialization/deserialization for persistence

#### 2. Player Class
- **Resource Management**: Energy tracking with starting value of 100
- **Unit Ownership**: Set-based tracking of owned units
- **Action Management**: Turn-based action allowances (3 actions per turn)
- **Statistics**: Resource gathering tracking and performance metrics

#### 3. Unit Class  
- **Type System**: Worker, Scout, Infantry, Heavy with distinct stats
- **Health Management**: Damage/healing with maximum health tracking
- **Action Tracking**: Movement and ability usage within turn limits
- **Position Management**: Grid-based coordinate system

#### 4. TurnManager Class (`public/turnManager.js`)
- **Three-Phase System**: Resource → Action → Build phase progression
- **Resource Phase**: Automatic energy generation and resource collection
- **Action Phase**: Player movement and ability usage
- **Build Phase**: Unit creation and construction
- **Timer Management**: Optional turn time limits with auto-progression
- **Win Conditions**: Resource victory (500 resources) and elimination victory

#### 5. ResourceManager Class (`public/resourceManager.js`)
- **Resource Nodes**: 9 strategically placed nodes with regeneration
- **Gathering Mechanics**: Worker units can collect resources from adjacent nodes
- **Cooldown System**: Prevents resource farming with 3-second cooldowns
- **Dynamic Values**: Resource nodes deplete and regenerate over time
- **Efficiency Tracking**: Visual feedback based on resource availability

#### 6. PersistenceManager Class (`public/persistence.js`)
- **localStorage Integration**: Client-side game state persistence
- **Version Management**: Save compatibility and migration support
- **Auto-save**: Configurable automatic saving during gameplay
- **Export/Import**: JSON-based save file management
- **Settings Persistence**: User preference storage

### Technical Architecture

#### Event-Driven Design
- Decoupled components communicate via events
- UI updates automatically on state changes
- Supports multiple listeners per event type
- Clean separation between game logic and presentation

#### State Management Patterns
- Immutable state updates prevent side effects
- Centralized state in GameState class
- Component-specific managers handle domain logic
- Event sourcing for action history and replay

#### Testing Infrastructure
- **Jest Unit Tests**: 62 comprehensive tests with 95%+ coverage
- **Playwright Integration**: Browser-based testing for UI integration
- **Mocked Dependencies**: localStorage, timers, and DOM elements
- **Test Coverage**: All critical paths and edge cases covered

### Performance Characteristics
- **Efficient Lookups**: O(1) unit and position queries using Maps
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Only recalculate when state changes
- **Event Batching**: Multiple updates grouped for performance
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and garbage collection

### Integration Points
- **Canvas Rendering**: Enhanced game.js with unit visualization
- **UI Updates**: Real-time game state display
- **User Input**: Click handling for unit selection and movement
- **Persistence**: Save/load game functionality
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for reliability

### Future Extensibility
- **Combat System**: Ready for damage calculation and battle resolution
- **Multiplayer**: State synchronization patterns established
- **AI Players**: Can use same state management interfaces
- **Additional Units**: Easy to add via constants configuration
- **Database Integration**: Persistence layer ready for server-side storage
