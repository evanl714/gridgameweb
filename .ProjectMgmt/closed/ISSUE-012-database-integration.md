# ISSUE-012: Database Integration (SQLite)

**Status:** Closed
**Created:** 2025-07-18
**Completed:** 2025-07-20
**Assignee:** Claude
**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** database, persistence, backend, phase-2

## Description

Integrate SQLite database for persistent game storage, player statistics, and match history tracking as the foundation for future online features.

**Time Estimate:** 6-8 hours
**Actual Time:** ~6 hours
**Dependencies:** [[ISSUE-011-local-multiplayer]]
**Task Reference:** [[task-12-database-integration]]

## Product Requirements Definition (PRD)

### Overview
Implemented comprehensive SQLite database integration providing persistent storage for game data, player statistics, and match history while maintaining full backward compatibility with localStorage.

### Key Features Delivered
1. **Efficient Database Schema** - JSON blob storage for game states with 6 optimized tables
2. **Dual Persistence Strategy** - Database + localStorage for offline-first operation
3. **REST API Layer** - Complete API endpoints for games, players, saves, and statistics
4. **Player Statistics** - Win/loss tracking, play time, performance metrics
5. **Match History** - Complete game outcome tracking with replay capability
6. **Auto-Save System** - Periodic saves with automatic cleanup
7. **Offline Support** - Graceful fallback when database unavailable

### Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: Express.js server with SQLite database using better-sqlite3
- **Database**: 6-table schema with JSON storage for performance
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with comprehensive error handling
- **Frontend**: Dual persistence layer with automatic failover
- **Storage**: Efficient JSON blob approach vs normalized tables

### Performance Characteristics
- Single-row reads/writes for complete game state
- Automatic cleanup of old data
- Indexed queries for fast statistics retrieval
- Connection pooling and transaction support

## Tasks

- [✓] Design database schema for games, players, states, results
- [✓] Create database connection layer
- [✓] Implement game state persistence
- [✓] Build player statistics tracking
- [✓] Add match history system

## Subtasks

- [✓] [[ISSUE-012-database-integration-a]] - Database schema design
- [✓] [[ISSUE-012-database-integration-b]] - Database connection layer
- [✓] [[ISSUE-012-database-integration-c]] - Game state persistence
- [✓] [[ISSUE-012-database-integration-d]] - Player statistics tracking
- [✓] [[ISSUE-012-database-integration-e]] - Match history system

## Related Issues

- Depends on: [[ISSUE-011-local-multiplayer]]
- Blocks: [[ISSUE-013-game-validation-testing]]

## Relationships

- Implements: [[task-12-database-integration]] from .tasks

## Acceptance Criteria

- [✓] SQLite database stores all game data persistently
- [✓] Games can be saved and resumed from database
- [✓] Player statistics are accurately tracked
- [✓] Match history is complete and accessible
- [✓] Database operations don't impact game performance

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified
- `server/database/schema.sql` - Complete database schema with 6 tables
- `server/database/connection.js` - Database connection and management layer
- `server/models/` - Game, GameSave, PlayerProfile models with CRUD operations
- `server/routes/api/` - RESTful API endpoints for all database operations
- `server/index.js` - Enhanced server with database initialization
- `public/databasePersistence.js` - Frontend database client with offline support
- `public/persistence.js` - Enhanced to use both database and localStorage

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **JSON Storage**: Chosen over normalized tables for performance and simplicity
2. **Offline-First**: Database + localStorage ensures no data loss
3. **API-First**: Clean separation enables future multiplayer features
4. **Auto-Cleanup**: Automatic maintenance prevents database bloat

## Comments

### 2025-07-18 - System Note

Keep database design simple but extensible. This foundation will support online multiplayer later.

### 2025-07-20 - Implementation Complete

Successfully delivered comprehensive SQLite integration with all acceptance criteria met. The implementation provides a solid foundation for future online features while maintaining full backward compatibility.
