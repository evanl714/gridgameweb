# Grid Strategy Game - Lean & Practical Implementation Plan

## Senior Developer Review: Major Issues with Previous Over-Engineered Plan

- **Over-engineered from day 1** - Redux, TypeScript, Docker for a simple grid game?
- **Analysis paralysis setup** - 50+ files before writing any game logic
- **Premature optimization** - Planning for scale before proving the concept works
- **Technology for technology's sake** - Adding complexity without clear value

## Revised Tech Stack (Start Simple, Scale Smart)

### MVP Phase

- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No build step, direct debugging, faster iteration
- **HTML5 Canvas** - Handles grid rendering efficiently
- **Node.js + Express** - Minimal server setup
- **SQLite** - Zero configuration database
- **Socket.io** - Only when multiplayer is actually needed

### Future Online Play (When Actually Needed)

- **Add TypeScript** - Only when codebase becomes complex
- **Add PostgreSQL** - Only when SQLite becomes limiting
- **Add Redis** - Only when session management becomes a bottleneck

## Implementation Strategy (Build What You Need, When You Need It)

### Week 1: Prove the Game is Fun

- Single HTML file with canvas grid
- Click to move pieces
- Basic turn logic
- No server needed yet

### Week 2: Add Local Multiplayer

- Split into client/server files
- Same-computer multiplayer (pass the device)
- SQLite to save game state

### Week 3: Network Multiplayer (If Previous Steps Work)

- Add Socket.io for real-time moves
- Simple room system (join by room code)
- Basic reconnection

### Week 4+: Polish Based on Usage

- Add features based on actual user feedback
- Scale only when performance becomes an issue
- Refactor only when complexity becomes unmaintainable

## Key Architecture Decisions

### What We're NOT Doing (Until We Need To)

- ❌ TypeScript (adds build complexity)
- ❌ React (overkill for canvas-heavy game)
- ❌ Redux (premature state management)
- ❌ PostgreSQL (SQLite handles 1000s of concurrent users)
- ❌ Redis (session management not needed for simple room codes)
- ❌ Docker (local development works fine)
- ❌ Microservices (single service handles everything)

### What We ARE Doing (Essential Only)

- ✅ HTML5 Canvas (perfect for grid games)
- ✅ Socket.io (when multiplayer is needed)
- ✅ Express (minimal server framework)
- ✅ SQLite (sufficient for most use cases)
- ✅ Git branches (following CLAUDE.md workflow)

## Online Play Readiness (Future-Proof Without Over-Engineering)

### Current Architecture Supports:

- **Room-based multiplayer** - Simple room codes
- **Real-time updates** - Socket.io events
- **Game persistence** - SQLite game state
- **Reconnection** - Store game state, rejoin by room code

### Easy Scaling Path (When Needed):

1. **Add caching** - Redis when SQLite queries slow down
2. **Add types** - TypeScript when codebase > 2000 lines
3. **Split services** - Multiple servers when single server can't handle load
4. **Add framework** - React when DOM manipulation becomes complex

## File Structure (Start Here)

```javascript
// public/game.js (Start with ~200 lines)
class Game {
  constructor() {
    this.canvas = document.getElementById("gameCanvas");
    this.ctx = this.canvas.getContext("2d");
    this.grid = new Grid(8, 8);
    this.currentPlayer = 1;
  }

  render() {
    /* draw grid */
  }
  handleClick(x, y) {
    /* game logic */
  }
}

// server/index.js (Start with ~100 lines)
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const GameLogic = require("./game-logic");

app.use(express.static("public"));
app.listen(3000);
```

## Why This Approach Works

1. **Faster to working game** - Code game logic in days, not weeks
2. **Easier debugging** - No build steps, direct browser debugging
3. **Simpler deployment** - Single Node.js process
4. **Clear upgrade path** - Add complexity only when justified by real problems
5. **Lower maintenance** - Fewer dependencies = fewer breaking changes

## Online Play Migration (When Actually Needed)

The simple architecture easily evolves:

- `game.js` → `client/` folder when it grows large
- Add Socket.io server when local multiplayer works
- Add PostgreSQL when SQLite can't handle load
- Add TypeScript when refactoring becomes frequent

**Bottom Line**: Build a working game first, optimize for problems you actually have, not problems you think you might have.
